# Richmond, VA – Public Park Access Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores the spatial distribution of public parks in Richmond, Virginia.
Using GIS and Python, I analyze park locations and visualize their geographic spread to
support discussions around access to public green space.

## Data Source
- City of Richmond Open Data Portal
- Dataset: Public Parks
- Geometry type: Polygon

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- GeoPandas
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Methods
- Loaded and inspected GIS data
- Verified coordinate reference system (CRS)
- Converted geometries to centroids for visualization
- Plotted park locations using latitude and longitude
- Exported map visualizations as PNG files

## Outputs
- Jupyter Notebook with full analysis
- Static map image showing park locations across Richmond

## Files
- `richmond_parks.ipynb` – analysis notebook
- `parks_map.png` – exported map visualization


## Next Steps
- Analyze park access by neighborhood
- Incorporate population or census data
- Measure distance to nearest park
